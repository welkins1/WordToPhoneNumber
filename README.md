# WordToPhoneNumber ☎️

This basic program allows you to translate a word to the corresponding numbers on a telephone.

Have you ever seen those 1-800 numbers with a word attached to them, such as 1-800-Money? This program translates that word to the number, so you don't have to remember which number has which letters.

I'm sure most people know the corresponding numbers, but this program simplifies the process.

It was surprisingly easy to create this program, and I didn't have to do anything fancy to get the results I wanted.

The for loop took a little bit to figure out, but other than that, the rest was easy.

In the future, I want to make it so a user can add spaces between words instead of the program only displaying one word or more than one word if they are inputted without a space. I don't think I will change how the program handles non-word/letter inputs as it makes it possible to enter a number with a word and display the number with the translation together (assuming the input is entered without spaces).

I think the ASCII art was a nice touch. Credit to Joan Stark via www.asciiart.eu/ for making it.

I also uploaded this program to GitHub via a Netbean git push. I'm glad I was able to find out I could do that as it simplifies uploading on this site.

# ⚙️ Setup

You can run this program by downloading the .java file and running ```java WordToPhoneNumber.java``` in the directory you installed it in.
